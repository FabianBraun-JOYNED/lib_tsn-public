A Gigabit Ethernet AVB endpoint example
---------------------------------------

Figure 2 shows the high level task and communication structure for the application.
The example consists of many tasks running in parallel.

.. _AN00202_task_diag:

.. figure:: images/task_diagram.*

   Task diagram of the AVB endpoint example

Specifically:

* The Gigabit Ethernet MAC which consists of 7 tasks and handles the RGMII interface and packet queuing.
* The Ethernet MAC configuration task which allows client tasks to configure MAC address filtering and other parameters.
* The AR8035 Ethernet PHY driver which configures PHY registers and periodically reads the link status.
* The SMI task which implements the MDIO register interface to the Ethernet PHY and communicates with the PHY driver.

The above tasks must be placed on Tile 1 of the XE216 microcontroller.

* The TDM master task from the XMOS I2S/TDM library which handles the TDM digital audio interface.
* The audio buffer manager to TDM handler which receives callbacks from the TDM task, initializes the audio codecs
  and PLL by communicating with the I2C master task (from the XMOS I2C library) and configures reset and clock frequency
  pins via a GPIO task.
* The audio input sample buffer task, which provides a handle to a double buffered audio buffer that shares memory between
  the audio buffer manager task and 1722 Talker task.
* The audio buffer manager task which performs buffering operations for input and output, then communicates free buffer
  locations with the TDM handler via a channel.
* The audio output sample buffer task, which provides a handle to sample FIFOs that share memory between the audio buffer
  manager task and the 1722 Listener.
* The 1722 Talker which packetizes audio samples from the audio input sample buffer into a 1722 stream with a presentation
  timestamp and stream ID, then forwards them to the Ethernet MAC for transmission.
* The 1722 Listener which receives 1722 stream packets from the Ethernet MAC, depacketizes audio samples from them,
  then buffers the samples in an audio output FIFO. The Listener also communicates with the media clock server to maintain the
  1722 presentation time and audio clock recovery.
* The gPTP and media clock server task which maintains a global time reference and implements clock recovery to
  synchronize the frequency and phase of the audio clock to the audio clock master on the network. This task also generates the
  low frequency reference signal to the Cirrus Logic CS2100-CP PLL.
* The 1722.1, MAAP and SRP task which combines the protocol stacks necessary to provide stream reservation and endpoint control.
* The AVB manager task which co-ordinates the communication and setup of all the tasks above.
* Finally, the application task, which sets up and implements application specific configuration and behavior via communication
  with the AVB manager and 1722.1 tasks.


Note that the application consists of 23 tasks implemented on 14 logical
cores. Combined or distributed tasks will be scheduled as required when they
are communicated with by the other tasks.

Makefile additions for this example
...................................

This example uses XMOS libraries which can be included in
the project via the ``USED_MODULES`` variable in the ``Makefile``::

 USED_MODULES = lib_tsn lib_i2s

A version number requirement is specified with the libraries to guarantee
compatibility.

The compiler flags include ``-g`` (to enable debug information) and
``-report`` (to give a resource usage report after compilation).

The ``-fxscope`` flag is used to enable xSCOPE output for real-time debug
printing on the host connected to the xTAG adapter. A define ``-DRGMII=1`` is
passed to the Ethernet library to indicate RGMII is being used and ``-lquadflash``
is used to link the Quad SPI flash library, which is bundled with the tools::

  XCC_FLAGS = -Os -save-temps -g -report -fxscope -DRGMII=1 -lquadflash

Compiler flags specific to a particular file can be specified in the Makefile as follows::

  XCC_FLAGS_main.xc = $(XCC_FLAGS) -falways-inline -O3

AVB endpoint configuration defines
..................................

The ``avb_conf.h`` file provides configuration #defines for the AVB endpoint and overrides defaults in the
lib_tsn library. These can be altered to suit the particular endpoint configuration required.

.. literalinclude:: avb_conf.h
   :start-on: Endpoint audio and clocking
   :end-on: FLASH_PAGE_SIZE


Declaring resources used by the application
...........................................

The example uses several hardware ports and clocks to drive and read I/O. These
are declared at the beginning of ``main.xc``

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: Ports and clocks
   :end-on: p_audio_shared

These ports are mapped to external pins on the XE216 device. Some ports can be moved if required to support
a different hardware portmap on another board.

The application main() function
...............................

The source code below is taken from the main function of the example application file ``main.xc``.

The declarations before the ``par`` create the connections between
the tasks (see :ref:`AN00202_task_diag`). Tasks are connected by
passing one of these declared variables to both tasks. Some of the
connections are arrays which can connect one task to many others.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: int main
   :end-on: i_audio_out_pull

The ``par`` functionality describes several tasks running in parallel across multiple logical cores on 2 tiles.

The Ethernet MAC and PHY configuration
......................................

The first four tasks are related to the Ethernet MAC and its configuration. These tasks must run on tile 1
of the xCORE due to the fixed nature of the RGMII ports. The ``rgmii_ethernet_mac`` task consumes seven xCORE
logical cores internally and the ``rgmii_ethernet_mac_config``, ``ar8035_phy_driver`` and ``smi`` tasks
are combined onto the single spare core on tile 1.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: rgmii_ethernet_mac
   :end-on: smi(

The ``ar8035_phy_driver`` task is defined within the application and is intended to be changed if a different
Ethernet PHY is used. The function first applies a reset pulse to the Ethernet PHY of 1000 ms:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: void ar8035_phy_driver
   :end-on: p_eth_reset <: 0xf;

Next, the Ethernet MAC is configured with the ingress and egress latencies in nanoseconds through the PHY.
These latencies are required to correct for the offset between the 802.1AS timestamp measurement plane relative
to the reference plane, as described in IEEE 802.1AS section 8.4.3, and are required for compliant behavior.

The latencies vary with the speed of the link and therefor a speed parameter is also provided. These values are
PHY specific and must be updated if a different PHY is used. They can be obtained experimentally or from the PHY
vendor.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: eth.set_ingress_timestamp_latency(0, LINK_1000_MBPS_FULL_DUPLEX
   :end-on: eth.set_egress_timestamp_latency(0, LINK_100_MBPS_FULL_DUPLEX

A library function ``smi_phy_is_powered_down`` is used to wait until the PHY is powered on before reading or
writing MDIO registers. The PHY is then configured via the SMI register interface. Energy Efficient Ethernet features of the PHY
must be disabled for AVB operation. The ``smi_configure`` library function configures the PHY speed and
auto-negotiation parameters.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: while (smi_phy_is_powered_down
   :end-on: SMI_ENABLE_AUTONEG

Finally, the task periodically polls the Ethernet link state (up/down) using the SMI library function
``smi_get_link_state``. Since link speed is not provided by a standard PHY register, a AR8035 specific
register must be read to obtain it. If the state has changed, the task communicates with the MAC to
inform it of the change. This information is then proxied through the Ethernet MAC to the AVB stack.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: // Periodically check the link status
   :end-on: XS1_TIMER_KHZ

Configuring GPIO
................

Tile 0 implements the AVB endpoint functionality and thus the non-Ethernet I/O must reside on the ports on this tile.

An I2C bus is used to configure the codecs and PLL on the multichannel audio board. The I2C clock and data
pins have been placed on a 4-bit port and therefore the multi-bit port I2C implementation is required.
This is instantiated by the ``i2c_master_single_port`` task, which takes the port, bus speed (100Kbps)
and bit positions of the clock and data within the multibit port as parameters.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: i2c_master_single_port
   :end-on: output_gpio

An output GPIO task allows a multibit port to be shared in a safe manner via xC interfaces. It takes a
4-bit port and mapping of pins within that port to be used for ADC, DAC reset lines and other strapping functions.

Both tasks are marked with a ``[[distributable]]`` attribute which means that they do not consume
a logical core and are scheduled on the core that the client interface is used.

The TDM master task
...................

The TDM master interface from ``lib_i2s`` is instantiated in its own logical core in the ``par``. The master clock
input from the PLL is configured to clock a clock block, of which the frequency is divided by 2 to provide the
bit clock used by the TDM task and driven to the codecs.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: configure_clock_src_divide
   :end-on: clk_tdm_bclk)

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: tdm_master
   :end-on: clk_tdm_bclk)

The buffer manager to TDM handler task
......................................

The ``tdm_master`` task is connected to the ``buffer_manager_to_tdm`` task
which is defined in the application. The connection between the
tasks will make 'callbacks' from the ``tdm_master`` task to the
application. The prototype of the TDM handling task is as below:

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
   :start-on: buffer_manager_to_tdm
   :end-on: mclk_select)

Note that:

  - The task takes the ``server`` side of the ``i2s_callback_if``
    interface. This means that the TDM master task will make calls
    into this task.
  - It also takes the ``client`` side of connections to the I2C bus
    and GPIO tasks. These allow this task to make calls to configure
    the hardware.
  - Finally, the task takes a ``streaming chanend`` argument which is an
    un-typed channel connection to the buffer manager task for
    sending/receiving samples.
  - The task is marked as ``[[distributable]]`` - this means that
    the task will only be implementing callbacks and can be run
    on the same logical core as the task making the calls.
  - It is also marked as ``[[always_inline]]`` to guarantee performance.

The task implements the callbacks via a 'while(1)-select'
construct. This represents an infinite loop that repeatedly responds to
calls from other tasks:

The calls it will respond to are defined in the
``i2s_callback_if`` in ``i2s.h``. There are four callbacks:
initialization, sending a sample, receiving a sample and checking for restart.

Configuring the audio hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``init`` callback occurs when the TDM bus initializes. At this
point the task will configure the audio hardware and buffering.
The TDM interface parameter fields of the ``i2s_config`` structure are first set
(see the I2S/TDM library documentation for more details).

The section of code following this makes calls on the GPIO and I2C interfaces to
configure the clock selection and codecs on the board.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
  :start-on: tdm.init
  :end-on: tdm_config.channels_per_frame

Communicating audio samples to/from the audio buffer manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The send and receive callbacks from TDM will pass samples to and from
the audio buffer manager task. An array in the ``audio_frame_t`` structure is
used to store the incoming samples. When the last sample in the frame is requested the task does
a channel exchange with the buffer manager task to swap to a unused buffer.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
  :start-on: tdm.send
  :end-on: // End of send

Setting the Ethernet MAC address
................................

A unique Ethernet MAC address is required for every device on an Ethernet network. XMOS has
preprogrammed the OTP memory on the xCORE-200 multichannel audio boards to contain a unique
MAC address in the XMOS OUI-24 range.

This MAC address can be read using the XMOS ``lib_otpinfo`` library and setup in the MAC using
the ``set_macaddr`` interface function on the MAC configuration interface as follows.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
  :start-on: char mac_address
  :end-on: .set_macaddr(

Customers designing their own hardware must use their own MAC address range assigned by the IEEE.
XMOS provides the ``xburn`` utility to program unique MAC addresses into OTP via JTAG. See the tools
user guide for more information.

MAC addresses may be read via a different method, such as from flash memory, but this is outside the
scope of this application note.

Configuring the AVB endpoint
............................

The main application control task, as prototyped below, is responsible for initializing the AVB
stack via the core AVB API and receiving control callbacks via 1722.1.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
  :start-on: // The main application control task
  :end-on: i_1722_1_entity)

Setting up the media clock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly, the audio clock is configured to a default of 48 kHz and set to type ``INPUT_STREAM_DERIVED``.
This means that the audio clock will be a slaved to an audio clock master and recovered from a Listener
stream (stream #0). The clock is then enabled.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
  :start-on: unsigned default_sample_rate
  :end-on: DEVICE_MEDIA_CLOCK_STATE_ENABLED

Configuring the Talker and Listener streams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Four Talker (source) and Listener (sink) streams are setup to use 8 channel, 24-bit MBLA formats and a one-to-one channel
mapping is configured to map stream channel 0 to TDM channel 0 and so on.

The streams are also configured to use the media clock defined above.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
  :start-on: AVB_NUM_SOURCES; j++)
  :end-on: set_sink_channels

Reacting to 1722.1 control commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A callback interface ``avb_1722_1_control_callbacks`` is used to implement custom functionality on receipt
of a 1722.1 control command. Currently supported commands via this interface are GET_CONTROL, SET_CONTROL,
GET_SIGNAL_SELECTOR and SET_SIGNAL_SELECTOR.

When the 1722.1 stack receives one these commands from a Controller, it will cause an event to be fired
on the relevant case statement. It is the responsibility of the application to process the index of the
control and return the correct status code to the 1722.1 stack, which will in turn respond to the Controller.

For example, when a SET_CONTROL command is received with index 0, the application looks up this value and
understands that this is the Identify control. It then reads the current identify control value, sets it in the
values array and returns a status code of ``SUCCESS`` to indicate that the operation was successful.

.. literalinclude:: main.xc
  :start-on: case i_1722_1_entity.set_control_value
  :end-on: return_status = AECP_AEM_STATUS_BAD_ARGUMENTS;

The example does a debug print on receipt of this control, but can be modified to any custom behavior
as required.

   XMOS xCORE-200 Multichannel Audio platform

A full overview of the hardware and its features is provide in the xCORE-200 Multichannel Audio Platform
Hardware Manual.

This example firmware is a fully compliant AVB endpoint that will interoperate with other compliant, third-party
endpoints. A Late 2013 MacBook Pro running OS X version 10.10.3 is used to demonstrate this capability. An
official Apple Thunderbolt to Gigabit Ethernet adapter is required if the Mac does not have a built-in Ethernet port.

All Apple Macs with a Thunderbolt port are AVB enabled.
